1. The quantifiable features of the resulting graphics. Some examples of aesthetics are position, color, line width, and line type.
2. Continous and discrete
3. Qualitative and quantitative.An example of qualitative data is dog,cat,fish.An example of quantitive data is 1,2,3,4.

5. Ordered: good, fair, poor
   unordered: dog, cat, fish

10. Polar coordinates can be useful for data of a periodic nature,such that data values at one end of the scale logically joined to data values at the other end.
11. Qualitative color scale:a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map.  
    sequential color scale:a sequence of colors that clearly indicate which values are larger or smaller than other ones and how distant two specific values are from each other. 
    diverging color scale: visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
    accent color scale: when specific values in a dataset carry key information ans we can emphasize the key information with colors.
12. The dataset on the y-axis(age) starts with negative numbers.
13. Purple-green

16.Part 1: Approximate Waelder City, Texas is the 1000th most populous city.
    Part 2: Approximate Edinburg City, Texas is the 1000th most populous city after the visualizing transformation.
